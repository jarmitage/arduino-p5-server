# arduino-p5-server

Toy example made for a student.

Send data from Arduino to a Node server and relay via Web Sockets to a web client running p5.js.

Unlike the examples in `p5.SerialPort`, this will allow you to visit the server from another device such as a mobile and still view data obtained via the serial port.
